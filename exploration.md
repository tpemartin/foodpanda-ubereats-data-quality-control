For menu csv, each shop is obtained several times through different anchoring GPS points of request. There is also a time stamp for each request.

  - Each anchoring point obtains different number of shops. Rank the anchoring points by the number of shops obtained.  
  - Plot time and number of shops obtained. (is there a correlation? does time of request matter? ).
