## ubereats_shoplist

I am using BigQuery under project id 'food-delivery-432217'. I need your assistance for SQL.

Create a SQL for data set 'ubereats_shoplist' that

  1. Set a table named "2024-9" called `stacked_table_name`.
  2. Look for all table names beginning with  `stacked_table_name`'s string value, then stack them together into one table, and name it as "stacked_"+`stacked_table_name`.
